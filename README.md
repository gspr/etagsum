## About

This software is in no way affiliated with AWS.

The code is licensed under the GNU General Public License, verson 3.0.

## Running

Invocations are similar to those of `sha256sum` and friends from GNU
Coreutils, but one needs to explicitly specify the chunk size. This is
done with the `--size` switch. In
```
etagsum --size 8M a b --size 16M c
```
the files `a` and `b` are checksummed with a chunk size of 8 MB, and
`c` with a size of 16 MB. AWS tools tend to pick 8 or 16 MB as defaults.

More options can be seen by running `etagsum --help`.
